# Bioinformatics Projects

**1) Extracting Gene Signatures Using Single-Cell Analysis in Head and Neck Cancer (August 2018 – May 2019)**

Using the SingleR library, analyzed and visualized single-cell gene expression data with t-SNE plots and heatmaps. Performed functional enrichment analysis (MSigDB) and survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier plots) to identify genes with significant survival relevance. Presented results at annual AAR poster session.

**2) Identifying Significant Metabolic Pathways in Cancers (June 2018 – August 2018)**

Identified significantly altered metabolic pathways in breast cancer and prostate cancer, based on differences in gene and metabolite expression. Performed probabilistic principal components analysis and calculated average absolute correlations to rank pathways, using R.

**3) Identifying Genomic Differences Between Two Lung Cancers (June 2017 – August 2017)**

Performed statistical analyses in R, including chi-squared tests, t-tests, and linear regression, to identify genomic differences between lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Analyzed gene expression, copy number variation, and patient clinical data.
